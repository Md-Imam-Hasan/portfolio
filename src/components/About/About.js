              <p>I am a <b>Web Developer</b> having a solid understanding of front-end technology mainly focused on React.</p>
              <p>Now letâ€™s talk about how I choose web development as my career. In the early year of my graduation, I found interest in coding. I learn DSA and start doing problem-solving on many online platforms. As a beginner, I was trying various programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and a couple of technology. After 3 years in 2019, I became a moderator of my departmental programming club called Euclid Programming Club. I helped many of my university juniors to learn to code. It was really fun and actually helping others is the best way of learning. One day, a friend of mine came to show me a problem with his website project that he was working on. It was PHP and I have no idea about PHP. Then I was thinking that as I know JavaScript and it is used to build websites so let try it out. I start learning React and it was quite fun and easy.</p>
              <p>I am a motivated person but I love to hear from people who motivated others. I love to talk about technology and try to learn more. I believe <b>learning means living</b>. </p>
